### Activity
- Create a [personal README](#personal-readme) and [submit](#submitting-your-assignment) via GitHub.

### Personal README:

- A personal README is a way to teach others how to best work with you. It is useful for expressing your learning style and personal preferences, likes and dislikes.
- For this exercise, you with use the `MARKDOWN` language (the language used to author this very README) to create your own personal version. Your version should incorporate __at least one picture, one list, appropriate headings, and be at least 300 words__.
- For inspiration, feel free to check out the examples at [Kaeti's repo][kaeti-repo] or do your own thing. Have fun, but keep it professional!
